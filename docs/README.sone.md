## The Vision

The Linux desktop app TIDAL never built.

SONE finally gives Linux users a first-class streaming client. It delivers the complete, fully-featured experience you expect with seamless library management and a sleek, familiar workflow—and then supercharges it.

We went beyond the basics with direct-to-DAC bit-perfect ALSA output, a resizable-adaptive floating miniplayer, music video playback, custom themes, Discord Rich Presence, and multi-service scrobbling (Last.fm, Libre.fm, ListenBrainz)—all wrapped in a fast, native Linux app.

## Features

### Audio

- **Lossless FLAC and MQA streaming** up to Hi-Res (24-bit/192kHz) with automatic quality fallback
- **Max streaming quality** — cap streaming at your preferred quality tier
- **Bit-perfect output** — no resampling, no dithering. Your DAC receives the unaltered decoded signal
- **Exclusive ALSA** — bypasses PipeWire/PulseAudio entirely for direct hardware access
- **Smart DAC matching** — automatically detects your hardware's supported formats and sample rates, picking the best fit
- **Signal Path Transparency** — see exactly what your audio is going through end-to-end. Probes the live GStreamer pipeline, OS mixer (`pactl`), and ALSA card (`/proc/asound`); flags every conversion, format mismatch, or volume alteration with a PRISTINE verdict for bit-clean playback
- **Volume normalization** (ReplayGain) with automatic context switching between album and track gain
- **Autoplay** — discovers and plays similar tracks when your queue ends
- **Gapless playback** — seamless, silence-free transitions between tracks in normal output mode. On by default; requires GStreamer 1.24+ and falls back automatically when unavailable

### Video

- **Music video playback** — a dedicated player (fullscreen or minimized to the bar) with adaptive HLS that starts at your selected quality; videos and tracks share one queue (shuffle, repeat, autoplay, history) controllable from the tray, MPRIS media keys, miniplayer, and shortcuts
- **Favorite & browse** — love videos separately from tracks, with dedicated Tracks/Videos tabs on your loved page — a paginated, searchable grid with tab-aware Play/Shuffle
- **Find videos** — add them to playlists (mixed playlists show accurate "N Videos · M Tracks"), and discover them across Explore and search — a Videos section, a dedicated Videos tab, and rows in Top Hits

### Interface

- **Custom themes** — 15 presets and a full color picker for accent and background with both light/dark mode
- **Lyrics** — synced lyrics display for supported tracks
- **Miniplayer** — compact floating window with album art, playback controls, and resizable-adaptive layout
- **Full-screen player** — maximized view with album art, lyrics option and auto-hiding controls
- **Queue persistence** — picks up where you left off across restarts
- **MPRIS integration** — media keys, shuffle, repeat, seek, and desktop widget support
- **Proxy support** — route traffic through HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS5 proxies
- **System tray** with playback controls and minimize-to-tray
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for all common actions with a built-in shortcut overlay

### Library

- **Library management** — browse and sort your playlists, albums, artists, and mixes with playlist folder support
- **Share** — share tracks, albums, playlists, artists, and mixes with your friends via a direct TIDAL link
- **Deep links** — open `tidal://` URLs directly in SONE
- **Profile** — edit your bio, social links, and avatar

### Integrations

- **MCP server** — built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server on port 5577 lets external AI agents (Claude Code, etc.) search your library, control playback, and manage playlists/favorites. Off by default; enable in Settings with one-click token generation
- **OBS overlay** — built-in browser source widget (port 5578) displays the currently playing track — album art, title, artist, audio quality badge, and a live progress bar — in any streaming software. Off by default; Enable in Settings, add the URL as a Browser Source in OBS at 400×120px. Inherits your active SONE theme automatically
- **Scrobbling** — track your listening history on Last.fm, Libre.fm, and ListenBrainz with full ISRC and MusicBrainz metadata
- **Play reporting** — reports finished plays to TIDAL so Recently Played reflects what you listen to in SONE. On by default; turn it off in Settings → Scrobbling
- **Discord Rich Presence** — show what you're listening to with album art, track info, and a direct TIDAL link

## Why SONE?

SONE is a lightweight, native alternative to the official TIDAL web player and Electron-based unofficial clients.

- **Full audio quality** — browsers and Electron apps downsample audio to 48kHz before it leaves the application. SONE is native — it outputs at the source's original sample rate, up to 192kHz (TIDAL's max). Exclusive ALSA mode bypasses the system mixer entirely for bit-perfect output to your DAC.
- **Familiar interface** — a modern UI inspired by the streaming apps you already use
- **Direct hardware access** — GStreamer talks directly to your audio hardware. Lock your DAC to the exact source format, bypassing the system mixer
- **Lightweight** — built with Tauri and Rust. Small binary, low memory footprint
- **Encrypted at rest** — credentials, cache, and settings are encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **No telemetry, no tracking** — fully open source under GPL-3.0. SONE collects no telemetry and sends nothing to its developers. Finished plays are reported to TIDAL so Recently Played works; turn it off in Settings → Scrobbling

Or add the repository so `apt upgrade` / `dnf upgrade` / `zypper up` keep SONE current automatically (the setup script auto-detects your distro and imports the signing key):

<details>
<summary><b>Debian / Ubuntu (apt)</b></summary>

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/lullabyx/sone/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt install sone
```

Derivatives (Kubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!\_OS, Zorin, MX, LMDE) use the same command.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Fedora (dnf)</b></summary>

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/lullabyx/sone/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash

### Snap Store

SONE is available on the Snap Store for any distribution with snap support. Install it via your software center or the CLI:

**Install the application**

```
sudo snap install sone
```

**Run the application**

```
sone
```

> For exclusive / bit-perfect ALSA output, also connect the hardware-access interface:
>
> ```
> sudo snap connect sone:alsa
> ```

</a>

### Nix

SONE ships a [Nix flake](flake.nix). On any system with Nix and flakes enabled, run it without installing:

```bash
nix run github:lullabyX/sone
```

Or install it into your profile:

```bash
nix profile install github:lullabyX/sone
```

The flake builds from source (no binary cache yet) and also exposes a development shell with every build and runtime dependency wired up:

```bash
nix develop github:lullabyX/sone   # then: pnpm tauri dev
```

### Building from source

**Rust:**

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

**Node.js** 22+ (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), or your preferred method)

**pnpm** 11.x:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@11.1.3
# or, if corepack ships with your Node install:
corepack enable
```

**System dependencies:**

<details>
<summary>Ubuntu / Debian</summary>

```bash
sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential curl wget file patchelf \
    libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev \
    libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
    gstreamer1.0-plugins-base gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav \
    libsecret-1-dev libasound2-dev xdg-utils \
    pulseaudio-utils
```

`pulseaudio-utils` provides the `pactl` binary, used by the signal-path panel to read OS mixer state (sink format/rate, volume, mute) in Normal mode. SONE runs without it but the Normal-mode panel will show degraded info. Exclusive mode is unaffected.

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo apt install -y gstreamer1.0-alsa
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fedora</summary>

```bash
sudo dnf install -y \
    gcc gcc-c++ make curl wget file patchelf \
    webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel openssl-devel dbus-devel \

    libsecret-devel alsa-lib-devel xdg-utils \
    pulseaudio-utils
```

`pulseaudio-utils` provides the `pactl` binary, used by the signal-path panel to read OS mixer state (sink format/rate, volume, mute) in Normal mode. SONE runs without it but the Normal-mode panel will show degraded info. Exclusive mode is unaffected.

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gstreamer1-plugins-base-tools
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Arch Linux</summary>

#### AUR

SONE is available on the AUR in two variants:

- [`sone`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sone) — builds from source
- [`sone-bin`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sone-bin) — pre-built binary, no compilation required

**Install with your AUR helper:**

```bash
yay -S sone       # build from source
# or
yay -S sone-bin   # pre-built binary
```

#### Manual Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
    base-devel curl wget file patchelf \
    webkit2gtk-4.1 gtk3 libayatana-appindicator librsvg openssl dbus \
    gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-plugins-bad gst-libav \
    libsecret alsa-lib xdg-utils \
    libpulse
```

`libpulse` provides the `pactl` binary, used by the signal-path panel to read OS mixer state (sink format/rate, volume, mute) in Normal mode. SONE runs without it but the Normal-mode panel will show degraded info. Exclusive mode is unaffected.

Optional (for exclusive ALSA output):

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed gst-plugin-pipewire alsa-plugins
```

</details>

**Build and run:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lullabyX/sone.git
cd sone
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev             # Development mode
pnpm tauri build           # Release build (produces .deb, .rpm, .AppImage)
```

**Using build scripts:**

Docker-based build scripts are provided in `build-scripts/build/` to produce distro-specific packages in isolated environments. Requires Docker.

```bash
./build-scripts/build/all.sh              # Build all packages in parallel (deb, rpm, pacman)
./build-scripts/build/deb.sh              # Build .deb only (Ubuntu 22.04)
./build-scripts/build/rpm.sh              # Build .rpm only (Fedora)
./build-scripts/build/pacman.sh           # Build pacman package only (Arch)
./build-scripts/build/all.sh --omit rpm   # Build all except rpm
```

Output goes to `dist/<format>/`. Pass `--no-cache` to force a clean Docker build.

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Click **Get Login Code**. You'll be automatically redirected to the official [link.tidal.com](https://link.tidal.com) to login and approve the code. Optionally, you can scan the **QR Code** to login via your mobile device.
3. Your library loads automatically — browse and play!

> [!NOTE]
> **NVIDIA GPU users:** If you see a blank window, rendering glitches, or a Wayland protocol error on launch, start the app with:
>
> ```bash
> WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 sone
> ```

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting</summary>

**No sound?**
Make sure GStreamer plugins are installed — you need at minimum `gstreamer1.0-plugins-base`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-good`, `gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad`, and `gstreamer1.0-libav` (or your distro's equivalents).

**Playback errors in exclusive/bit-perfect mode?**
SONE automatically detects your DAC's supported formats and sample rates, but if playback still fails, your hardware may not support the source format at all. Try a lower quality tier or switch to normal output mode.

**"Error 71 (Protocol error) dispatching to Wayland display" on launch?**
This is a known WebKitGTK/Wayland issue affecting Tauri apps on systems with NVIDIA GPUs ([tauri-apps/tauri#10702](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/10702)). As a workaround, launch SONE with the DMA-BUF renderer disabled:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 sone
```

If you're using X11 or don't have an NVIDIA GPU but still see this error, try updating your WebKitGTK and graphics drivers to the latest versions.

**Blank window or rendering glitches on NVIDIA?**
If the app launches but shows a blank/white window or has visual artifacts, try disabling WebKit's compositing mode:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 sone
```

This is a known issue with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers and WebKitGTK hardware acceleration.

</details>

## Custom theme file

The theme presets/custom colors are stored in `theme.json`, inside SONE's config
directory. **That directory depends on how you installed SONE**, because Flatpak
and Snap both redirect `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` into their own sandbox:

| Install | `theme.json` |
| --- | --- |
| Native (AUR, `.deb`, `.rpm`, AppImage) | `~/.config/sone/theme.json` |
| Flatpak | `~/.var/app/io.github.lullabyX.sone/config/sone/theme.json` |
| Snap | `~/snap/sone/current/.config/sone/theme.json` |

A sandboxed SONE cannot read `~/.config/sone/`, so tools that write the theme
for you need the matching path above.

SONE reads the file **at startup, and whenever the window regains focus**. A
change made while SONE is unfocused or in the tray is applied the next time you
focus the window, not immediately.

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "preset": "custom",
    "custom": {
        "accent": "#3B82F6",
        "background": "#0E1118"
    }
}
```

- `preset` = `"custom"`, or one of the built-in preset names (e.g. `"Ocean"`, `"Forest"`, `"Noir"`), case-sensitive.
- `custom.accent` / `custom.background` = `#RGB` or `#RRGGBB` colors.
- Both keys are required, even when `preset` names a built-in — `{"preset": "Ocean"}` on its own is rejected.
- Strict JSON only: comments and trailing commas are not accepted.

When `preset` names a built-in, that preset's colors win and `custom` is ignored
for display. SONE rewrites `custom` to match the preset the next time you change
the theme in Settings.

A file SONE cannot parse is left alone and the in-app theme is kept. Fix the
file and restart, or change the theme in Settings to overwrite it.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Is SONE free and open source?</summary>

Yes. SONE is fully open source under the GPL-3.0 license, with no telemetry or tracking — SONE itself collects nothing about you. Your play history is reported to TIDAL so Recently Played reflects what you play in SONE; disable it in Settings → Scrobbling.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need a TIDAL subscription?</summary>

Yes. SONE is a client for TIDAL and requires an active paid TIDAL subscription. SONE is an independent project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by TIDAL.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Which Linux distributions are supported?</summary>

Any modern Linux distribution. SONE is on Flathub (works everywhere), and ships native packages for Debian/Ubuntu (`.deb`), Fedora and openSUSE (`.rpm`), and Arch Linux (AUR).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does SONE support offline downloads?</summary>

No. SONE is a streaming client only — it streams directly from TIDAL and does not download tracks for offline playback.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I watch music videos?</summary>

Yes. SONE plays TIDAL music videos in a dedicated player — fullscreen or minimized to the player bar — and videos share the same queue, shuffle, repeat, autoplay, favorites, and history as your audio tracks. You can browse and search videos, love them, and add them to playlists. Video audio is streamed and does not use the bit-perfect lossless signal path that music tracks use.

</details>

<details>
<summary>I'm getting a "Device busy" error in exclusive or bit-perfect mode</summary>

Your system's sound server (PulseAudio or PipeWire) or another application is already using the ALSA device. Exclusive and bit-perfect modes need direct hardware access — only one application can hold the device at a time.

To fix this, either close the other application using the device, or select a different output device in SONE's settings.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the difference between exclusive mode and bit-perfect mode?</summary>

Both bypass your system's sound server (PulseAudio/PipeWire) and write directly to the ALSA hardware device. The difference is in how much processing happens before audio reaches your DAC.

**Exclusive mode** locks the ALSA device so no other application can use it. Audio is converted to a fixed format (32-bit integer, stereo) while preserving the source's native sample rate — no resampling occurs. You still have software volume control and volume normalization (ReplayGain).

**Bit-perfect mode** goes a step further. There is zero processing — no format conversion, no resampling, no volume control. The decoded audio reaches your DAC exactly as it was encoded. The volume slider is locked at 100% and disabled. This is the mode to use if you want the purest signal path to your DAC.

In short: exclusive gives you direct hardware access with volume control. Bit-perfect gives you a completely unaltered signal.

**TL;DR** — SONE is an open-source, native Linux desktop client for TIDAL built with Tauri 2 and Rust. It streams lossless FLAC and Hi-Res audio up to 24-bit/192kHz, with exclusive ALSA output that bypasses PulseAudio and PipeWire entirely for bit-perfect playback directly to your DAC. It also plays TIDAL music videos in a dedicated player — fullscreen or minimized to the bar — that shares a single queue (shuffle, repeat, autoplay, favorites, and history) with your audio tracks. Lightweight and encrypted at rest, with no telemetry or tracking.
